The theme of this escape room is “Enchanted Forest.”
The goal is to find the Forest Guardian’s Amulet and use it to open the magical portal home.

Location 1: Woodland Clearing

The player awakens in a circular clearing surrounded by glowing mushrooms and towering trees.
Light filters in through the canopy in shades of green and gold. A faint magical hum echoes.

There is one exit to the east, leading deeper into the forest.

To the north sits a stone pedestal covered in ancient carvings.
On top is a wooden box with a leaf-shaped lock. It requires a Leaf Key.

To the west, tangled roots conceal a hollow tree trunk with two compartments:
- The top compartment opens freely.
- The bottom compartment is sealed with a 3-symbol rune lock.

Inside the top compartment, the player finds a note written in shimmering ink:

“The key of leaves is held by the creature of riddles.
Seek the owl whose eyes see truth.”

This hint leads to the next room.

The rune lock requires a three-symbol sequence.
Nearby, on the pedestal, there are faint carvings showing:
Sun → Moon → Star
This is the code.

Opening it reveals the Leaf Key.

Using the Leaf Key unlocks the wooden box, which contains:
- A glowing Forest Charm, needed later.

Exiting east leads onward.


Location 2: Ancient Grove

Twisting trees form natural archways overhead.
At the center stands a massive stone owl statue with glowing gemstone eyes.

When the player approaches, the owl speaks:

“Answer me three questions, traveler, and I shall gift you what you seek.”

The owl asks:
	1.	“What rises in the morning sky?”
(Answer: Sun)
	2.	“What guides the tides?”
(Answer: Moon)
	3.	“What shines beyond all else?”
(Answer: Star)

These answers correspond to the symbols found earlier.

Upon answering all three correctly, the owl lifts a stone wing and reveals the Forest Guardian’s Amulet.

A path to the south glows open.


Location 3: Portal Glade

A swirling magical portal ripples before a standing stone arch.
Vines crawl up its frame, and the air is filled with sparkles of light.

The portal is inactive.

At its base lies a stone inscription reading:

“Only the Guardian’s light may open the way.”

Using the Forest Charm and the Forest Guardian’s Amulet together causes them to fuse, unleashing a burst of green magic.

The portal activates.

The player steps through and escapes.
