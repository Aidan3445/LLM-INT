The theme of this escape room is "Medieval Castle".
The goal is to reach the dining room for dinner at the bottom of the tower.


Room 1: Tower Bedroom
The player wakes up in a bedroom atop a tall tower with stone walls dimly lit by flickering candles.
Outside the window, the sun is setting over the mountains, there is a window to the west.
In the room there is a bed, a locked closet, and a dresser with three stacked drawers, the middle is locked.

The only exit to the room is a wooden trap door in the floor, which is also locked. (Alias direction "down" to "south")

Locked inside the closet is a note from the queen that reads:
  "My precious daughter, never forget who you are - a princess of this realm. 
  Your father and I await you at dinner. Love, Mother the Queen"
This note is a clue that will be useful later. Revealing that the player is a princess.

Inside the unlocked top drawer of the dresser is a note from the king that reads:
  "My dearest daughter, remember that Philip always serves us faithfully. 
  The numbers of our family are important: I was born in year 476. Love, Father the King"
This note reveals the code required to unlock the middle drawer of the dresser.

Locked in the middle drawer of the dresser (behind the code 476) is a wooden key. 
This key unlocks the closet and the trap door.


Room 2: Spiral Staircase
A long spiral staircase winding down the interior of the tower. 
Stone walls are lined with portrait paintings, each with a nameplate and description beneath.

There is a door to the east leading to the dining room.

The first portrait is a painting of a stern man in servant's attire, labeled:
  "Philip - Head Butler. Responsible for maintaining the household and overseeing meal service."

The second portrait is a painting of a sad-looking young boy alone, labeled:
  "Jack - Stable Boy. Orphaned at age 7. Parents rest in the castle graveyard. Works hard caring for the horses."

The third portrait is a painting of an elegant noblewoman, labeled:
  "Lady Margaret - Court Advisor. Known for her wisdom and connection to the royal family."

The heavy oak door to the dining room is locked, when you try to open it 
a voice behind the door asks three questions which you must answer correctly to enter:
  "Who is the head butler of the castle?" (Answer: Philip) (hint: check the portraits for someone who works in the household)
  "Where is Jack's father buried?" (Answer: Castle graveyard) (hint: read Jack's portrait carefully)
  "Who are you?" (Answer: Princess) (hint: find the second note in the tower bedroom)


Room 3: Grand Dining Room
A magnificent dining hall with a long table set for a feast. 
The King and Queen sit at the head of the table, smiling warmly. Candles illuminate platters of delicious food.

In the room is a wonderful spread of food on a grand table: roasted meats, fresh bread, fruits, and desserts.
