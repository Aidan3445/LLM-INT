The theme of this escape room is “Abandoned Space Station.”
The goal is to reactivate the escape shuttle and return safely to Earth.

Location 1: Cryosleep Chamber

The player awakens inside a frosted cryopod.
The chamber is dim, illuminated only by flickering red emergency lights.
Frost covers the glass windows on the north wall, beyond which only the void of space stretches endlessly.

To the south is a sealed airlock door leading deeper into the station.

Against the eastern wall stands a crew locker, locked with a magnetic card reader.
A small control console sits on a western counter, and the player notice it has two compartments—one open, one sealed with a small keypad.

Inside the console’s unlocked top compartment, the player finds a scientist’s datapad.
Its screen glows with a handwritten message:

“Systems failing… Commander Vega entrusted maintenance to Engineer Pierson.
He always said to remember his favorite number: 3.14.”

The lower compartment is locked with a three-digit combination, and the hint clearly points toward the code 314.
Inside is a crew keycard.

Using the keycard, the player can unlock the crew locker. Inside, there is a sealed letter:

“Crew member, remember who you are.
You are Pilot Tiernan of Earth Fleet.
Only you can initiate the shuttle launch.
—Commander Vega”

Finally, the same keycard unlocks the airlock door, allowing the player to descend into the heart of the dying station.


Location 2: Central Corridor

The central corridor is long and metallic, lit by sporadic overhead flickers.
Three glowing holographic portraits line the walls.

The first portrait shows a smiling man in a jumpsuit labeled:

Engineer Pierson — Chief Engineer.
Responsible for repair, maintenance, and power systems.

The next shows a young cadet, her eyes downcast:

Cadet Juno — Communications trainee.
Lost her family during the Europa Outpost collapse.

The third portrays a proud commander in uniform:

Commander Vega — Leader of Station One.
Known for bravery and devotion to crew.

At the far east end of the corridor is the escape shuttle hatch, locked and sealed tight.
A small terminal beside it flashes with three security questions:
	1.	“Who maintained the station’s power systems?”
(Answer: Pierson)
	2.	“Where did Cadet Juno’s family perish?”
(Answer: Europa Outpost)
	3.	“Who are you?”
(Answer: Pilot Tiernan — from the Commander’s message)

Entering the correct answers causes the hatch to unlock with a hiss of releasing pressure.


Location 3: Shuttle Bay

Bright lights flood the shuttle bay—the only functioning part of the station.
A compact white-and-silver escape shuttle sits idle on its landing struts, its engines humming faintly as though waiting for you.

Once the player boards the shuttle, the computer scans their identity and displays one final confirmation screen:

“PILOT TIERNAN — READY FOR LAUNCH.”


Win Message:
You launch the escape shuttle, leaving the derelict station behind.
You are finally heading home. You win! 🚀
