The theme of this escape room is “Haunted Theatre.”
The goal is to find the missing spotlight crystal and perform the final cue to lift the curse.

Location 1: Backstage Dressing Room

The player appears inside an old dressing room lined with cracked mirrors and dusty lights.
A ghostly violin plays faintly somewhere beyond the walls.

An exit leads west to the main stage.

On the north counter stands a makeup cabinet with two drawers.
- The top drawer is unlocked.
- The bottom drawer has a 3-digit lock.

Inside the top drawer, the player finds a torn script page reading:

“The final cue is lit by the number of acts…
Our beloved show ran for three.”

This is a clue for the 3-digit code: 0-0-3.

Inside the bottom drawer, they find a brass key.

The dressing room also contains a locked wardrobe with a keyhole shaped like a comedy mask.
The brass key fits perfectly.

Inside is a note:

“The spotlight crystal lies where the applause never ends—
in the seats of the forgotten audience.”

This directs the player to the auditorium.


Location 2: Main Stage

Dusty curtains hang on either side of a grand but decaying stage.
Rows of empty theatre seats stretch into darkness to the west.

A spotlight machine, broken and crystal-less, sits overhead.

On a music stand is a book titled “Audience Attendance Records”.
Inside, one page is circled:

“Seat A5: Lost item reported by usher.”

Examining the seat row labeled A reveals that seat A5 has a loose cushion.
Hidden beneath it is the Spotlight Crystal.

Placing the crystal into the stage spotlight causes a ghostly whisper:

“Take your final bow…”

A door to the south creaks open.


Location 3: Phantom Balcony

A balcony overlooking the theatre, draped in faded velvet.
The air is icy cold, and a solitary ghost—the Phantom of the Theatre—sits at the railing.

He asks one question:

“How many acts were in our final show?”

The answer, from the script clue, is three.

When answered correctly, the ghost smiles and bows.
A swirling exit of light appears.

The player steps through the spectral doorway and escapes the haunted theatre.


WIN MESSAGE:

The theatre lights blaze to life one last time as the curse lifts. You escape the haunted stage forever. You win!
